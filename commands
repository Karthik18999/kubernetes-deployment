Today I completed a practical Kubernetes deployment and explored core workload management commands.

🔧 Commands I worked with:

• minikube start – Initialized the local Kubernetes cluster
• minikube version – Verified installation
• kubectl version – Validated client-cluster connectivity

📦 Deployment Management:
• kubectl apply -f deployment.yml – Deployed application using declarative configuration
• vim deployment.yml – Modified deployment configuration

📊 Monitoring & Debugging:
• kubectl get deployments – Checked deployment status
• kubectl get pods – Verified pod health
• kubectl get pods -o wide – Viewed node placement & IP details
• kubectl get pods -w – Watched rollout in real time
• kubectl describe deployment <name> – Inspected rollout conditions
• kubectl describe pod <name> – Debugged pod-level events

🗑 Testing Self-Healing:
• kubectl delete pod <name> – Observed automatic pod recreation via Deployment
